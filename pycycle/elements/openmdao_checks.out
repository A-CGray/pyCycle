INFO: checking dup_inputs
WARNING: The following components have multiple inputs connected to the same source, which can introduce unnecessary data transfer overhead:
   nozz.mux has inputs ['MN:W', 'Ps:W'] connected to flow_start.exit_static.flow_static.Fl_O:stat:W
   nozz.mux has inputs ['Ps:P', 'Ps_calc'] connected to nozz.press_calcs.Ps_calc
