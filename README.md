# pyCycle
--------------

This is a thermodynamic cycle modeling library, designed primarily to model jet engine performance. 
It is built on top of the OpenMDAO framework and the design is heavily inspired by NASA's NPSS software.
You need to be at least familiar with either OpenMDAO or NPSS in order to be successful in using this library. 

Disclosure: The docs are nearly non-existent. We're hoping to improve this, but for the moment this is what you get. 
We suggest you look in the examples folder for some indications of how to run this code. 


## Installation
